Loqu, Inc. is incorporated Aug 2025 to innovate the language learning market. We build AI-powered social platform for language learners.

Traditional language learning apps teach vocabulary and grammar in isolation, creating a gap between completing lessons and having real conversations. This causes high dropout rates.

We offer a "use-then-learn" experience through a dual-language social platform that works like Twitter with different modes for each skill level. AI generates content and helps users create engaging posts by writing and speaking.
